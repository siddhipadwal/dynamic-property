# Hostinger Environment Variables for Next.js
# IMPORTANT: Next.js doesn't read .htaccess directly!
# You must set these in Hostinger hPanel under: Settings > PHP > Environment Variables

# For reference, these are the values that should be set:
# DB_HOST = localhost (NOT 127.0.0.1)
# DB_USER = u812564579_Shivank
# DB_PASSWORD = Bless@Shivank#321
# DB_NAME = u812564579_Shivank

# This .htaccess is for PHP compatibility only
